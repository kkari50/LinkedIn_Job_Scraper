1685630821,Business Intelligence Analyst,Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International,"Burbank, CA, US",4 weeks ago,Over 200 applicants,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/externalApply/1685630821?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjobs%2Edisneycareers%2Ecom%2Fjob%2Fburbank%2Fbusiness-intelligence-analyst%2F391%2F14880148&urlHash=tmtY&refId=8513845a-2dd1-4bee-8b68-8b6885504bee&trk=guest_job_details_apply_link_offsite,"Job Summary

The Direct-to-Consumer International (DTCI) segment of The Walt Disney Company is seeking a Business Intelligence Analyst with a strong business acumen and the technical skills necessary to uncover and present insights to various business stakeholders at Movies Anywhere (MA). This position will report to the Manager of Analytics for Movies Anywhere.

Movies Anywhere is a cloud-based digital movie service. This app for iOS, Android, Web, and 10-foot devices (Apple TV, Roku, etc.) enables consumers to discover, purchase, and watch movies from participating studios (Disney, Fox, Sony, Warner Bros., Universal) using a single service, regardless of the online retailer used to purchase those movies.

The Business Intelligence Analyst will use customer attributes, purchase transaction data, and event-level data from the Movies Anywhere apps to build dashboards, perform ad-hoc analyses, and generate insights that various teams at Movies Anywhere (including product, marketing, finance, strategy) can use to make better business decisions. Members of the analytics team at Movies Anywhere are expected to become experts in how consumers interact with the app and what product and marketing experiences will increase engagement, retention, and lead to increased returns to the participating studios. This role will have influence in the future direction of the product.

Responsibilities
Analyze customer cohorts to design maps of the customer journeys both inside and outside the product
Develop a deep understanding of engagement and retention drivers by cohort and provide insight on which product features are most effective in increasing retention and engagement
Uncover and recommend product improvement opportunities that would lead to increased purchase behavior (both inside and outside the app)
Help define metrics/KPIs for new product features and build automated dashboards that can display those KPIs for internal stakeholders
Help ideate and analyze A/B testing experiments to grow the MA user base and increase the number of core and engaged users
Ask and answer the next question(s) after gathering and analyzing the data to make insights more powerful – not just delivering what was asked for!

Basic Qualifications
Powerful SQL skills – almost all of the data we work with is accessible in our Amazon Athena SQL environment. We use JOINs, conditional aggregations (SUM(CASE WHEN), etc.) almost every day to combine data from different sources to understand our users and the performance of product features and marketing campaigns
Business acumen – ultimately, the analyses we perform need to lead to insights and business decisions. It’s not enough to be able to “pull data” and create reports and dashboards that others have requested; our team needs to combine product and consumer expertise with a sense of the bigger picture (general business landscape in which MA operates) to help influence and drive marketing and product decisions
Initiative – if you have something you want to learn about or think will make an impact, you will not only have the freedom to explore, but also you will be expected to do so
Ability to work independently – we understand that it will take some for you to become familiar with the product, our users, and our data, so you can expect to receive ample guidance and direction when you start. Over time, as you become an expert in our business, you will be asked to provide forecasts and recommendations that you will need to build/develop independently
Communication skills – some of the analyses we do are quite technical, but they need to be communicated to executive teams, both internal to MA and to studio leadership teams
Problem-solving ability – Our stakeholders don’t always know the right question to ask, so we often have to figure out what the real question or desired outcome before conducting an analysis
Data visualization skills (Tableau) – Putting together visualizations that update automatically allows our team to only need to do something once, rather than on a daily/weekly/monthly basis. This role needs to be able to turn the results of a complicated SQL query into something that a non-technical person can easily understand

Preferred Qualifications
Experience analyzing a digital product and its users – it’s what we do every day, so any examples you have that demonstrate the value you can bring to a digital product will make you a stronger candidate
Data manipulation skills using Python/R – sometimes we need to do analyses that SQL/Excel can’t handle, so a nice-to-have is being able to work with data using Python (Pandas) or R

The Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization owns Amazon’s global inventory management systems: we decide what, when, where, and how much we should buy to meet Amazon’s business goals and to make our customers happy. We do this for millions of items, for hundreds of product lines worth billions of dollars of inventory world-wide. Our systems are built entirely in-house, and are on the cutting edge in automated large-scale business, inventory and supply chain planning and optimization systems. We foster new game-changing ideas, creating ever more intelligent and self-learning systems to maximize the efficiency of Amazon's inventory investment and placement decisions.

The Fulfillment Insights team is focused on using cutting edge science to improve customer outcomes and transform our logistics, along with machine learning, and scalable distributed software in the cloud that automates and optimizes shipments to customers under the uncertainty of demand, pricing and supply. When customers place orders, our systems use real time, large scale optimization techniques to optimally choose from where to ship and how to consolidate multiple orders so that customers get their shipments on time or faster with the lowest possible transportation costs. One of our core responsibilities is to leverage big data to identify key patterns of success and failure, identify the areas we need to focus on first, understand root cause(s) that triggered failure, and to build predictive models that will help fix the most impactful problems. The amount of data, the variables that come into play, and diversity of customers and locations make this role very challenging and also fun. It's great for those who love solving problems, especially when dealing with a lot of ambiguity and asking lots of smart questions that will lead to the discovery of universal concepts, and truly innovative ML solutions that continuously improve the customer delivery experience.

As a Business Intelligence Engineer on Fulfillment Insights, you will:
Directly interface with business customers, gathering requirements and delivering complete BI solutions.
Analyze and extract relevant information from large amounts of data to help automate and optimize solutions to key business problems.
Conceptualize models and solutions essential to delivering customer value.
Work closely with research science, data & software engineering teams to build model implementations and integrate successful models and algorithms in production systems at very large scale.
Recognize and adopt best practices in reporting and analysis: data integrity, test design, analysis, validation, and documentation
Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large scale data analyses, model development, model validation and model implementation.

At the center of that hiring process is the most important stakeholder: the candidate.

The Business Intelligence Engineer, RHMD & Interview Experience will be responsible for the distribution of the RHMD survey, data summarization and visualization, and company-wide analysis. In 2019, the survey was sent to 195,284 phone screen and 219,330 candidates, creating a deep dataset. Each week the BIE manages batch distribution of surveys through a semi-automated connection to the survey platform (Qualtrics), and for the semi-automated e-mail push of feedback summaries to recruiters. We would like to expand the distribution of results to a wider audience to include interviewers and bar raisers, which would require further development of automation processes, including building privacy rules. The BIE manages the reporting dashboard for RHMD results, which is available for the company-wide GTA organization of over 4,000 users. Individual recruiters, recruiting coordinators, and recruiting managers file tickets with the BIE for reporting feature requests, bug fixes, or investigations.

This role will be the dedicated Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) owning data, reporting, and analysis related to the core cultural bedrock for Amazon interviewing: the Bar Raisers. As Amazon's growth skyrocketed in the past few years, the demands on the recruiting teams, interviewers, and Bar Raisers grew as well. A major focus in scaling the BR program was on supply vs demand--do we have enough Bar Raisers to be able to facilitate thousands of interviews expected each year? Today, that demand planning is still paramount, but a new set of questions need to be explored:
How can we continue to scale the program as Amazon grows?
How do we look beyond just Bar Raisers and upskill the rest of the interviewers at Amazon? That is, how can every interviewer at Amazon act like a Bar Raiser?
How do we effectively communicate process changes and program research to an ever-expanding base, and gather relevant feedback without requiring consensus on decisions?
How can the role of the Bar Raiser evolve as our Recruiting and Talent Assessment teams experiment with alternative interview processes?
With these questions in mind, the BIE, Interview Experience will be responsible for managing the ETL jobs connecting interview and bar raiser data from PeopleTech’s Tier 1 and Tier 2 datasets with a front-end reporting tool in QuickSight for company-wide bar raisers, bar raisers in training (BRITs), recruiting coordinators, and bar raiser program managers. The reporting tool was launched in Q2 2019, and has since been utilized by 3,249 unique users across 47 countries. The tool provides bar raisers with interview activity counts to help drive ownership of their contributions as bar raisers. BR program managers are able to view interviewers within each org who reach eligibility for BR nominations based on tenure and interview counts. Recruiting coordinators are able to view bar raiser and BRIT activity scheduled for the coming weeks to know who should/should not be reached out to for an interview request based on their current encumbrance.

Enhancements are required for this dashboard to connect Student Programs interview activity data with data from corporate recruiting tools (Hire and iCIMS); this work requires backend data engineering. Individual BRs, BRITs, RCs, and BR program managers file tickets with the BIE for reporting feature requests, bug fixes, or investigations. In addition to the existing BR dashboard, this BIE will be responsible for all data and reporting for the bar raiser program, including several unanswered questions today about bar raiser headcount health within each Steam.

Are you passionate about leveraging data to deliver actionable insight that impacts daily business decisions for Amazon? Does the prospect of dealing with massive volume of data excite you?

Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) powers the physical engine at the heart of Amazon Retail.

Are you passionate about leveraging data to deliver actionable insight that impacts daily business decisions for Amazon? Does the prospect of dealing with massive volume of data excite you?

Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) powers the physical engine at the heart of Amazon Retail. AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move many millions of units of inventory, employ hundreds of thousands of employees, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.

Amazon has a culture of data-driven decision-making, and demands business intelligence that is timely, accurate, and actionable. Our ideal candidate thrives in a fast-paced environment, relishes working with large transactional volumes and big data, enjoys the challenge of highly complex business contexts (that are typically being defined in real-time), and, above all else, is a passionate about data and analytics.

As a Business Intelligence Engineer you will be conducting large scale data analysis and providing business insights based upon data to further improve our operations and processes. Identifying non-existent data fields to improve existing KPIs would be a key responsibility for this role. Understandings around internal fulfillment center operations will be a plus.

A successful candidate knows and loves working with business intelligence tools, is comfortable accessing and working with big data from multiple sources, and passionately partners with the business to identify strategic opportunities and deliver results. You should have an internal drive to answer “why?” questions, excellent analytical abilities, strong technical skills, as well as superior written and verbal communication skills. S/he would be a self-starter, comfortable with ambiguity, able to think big (while paying careful attention to detail), and enjoy working in a fast-paced dynamic environment.

Key Responsibilities Include

You will also have the opportunity to display your skills in the following areas:
Analyze and solve problems at their root, stepping back to understand the broader context.
Use data mining, model building, and other analytical techniques to develop and maintain customer segmentation and predictive models to drive the business.
Respond to high priority requests from senior business leaders.
Learn and understand a broad range of Amazon’s data resources and know when, how, and which to use and which not to use.
Interface with other technology teams to extract, transform, and load data from a wide variety of data sources using SQL and Redshift.
Interface with business customers to gather requirements.
Model data and metadata to support ad-hoc and pre-built reporting.
Own the design, development, and maintenance of ongoing metrics, reports, analyses, dashboards, etc. to drive key business decisions.
Recognize and adopt best practices in reporting and analysis: data integrity, test design, analysis, validation, and documentation.
Tune application and query performance using Unix profiling tools and SQL.
Continually improve ongoing reporting and analysis processes, automating or simplifying self-service support for secondary datasets
Help answer challenging business questions for implementation through technology ultimately delivered to business and operations partners.

Basic Qualifications
Bachelors degree in a quantitative field such as Business, Economics, Analytics, Mathematics, Statistics or Operations Research.
5+ years experience as a business analyst, data scientist or similar job function
Ability to develop experimental and analytic plans for data modeling processes, use of strong baselines, ability to accurately determine cause and effect relations
Design, implement, and support infrastructure providing secured access to large datasets.
Verbal/written communication & data presentation skills, including an ability to effectively communicate with both business and technical teams

Who we are
The EC2 Customer Success Engineering Team (CSET) protects and improves the customer experience with Compute Services, keeping our customers happy and on our services. We act as the nexus of EC2 service teams. We identify and common customer pain points across services and tackle them. We raise the bar on internal practices and alleviate operational bottlenecks that hinder forward movement on making proactive improvements for customers.

“Nothing is beyond our reach”

We operate by the slogan that “nothing is beyond our reach”. We think big. We sometimes find ourselves asking “how in in the world is there no tool or solution for this?”, or “how have we managed to operate like this for so long?”. Our response in these moments, is “well, let’s fix it”. If the idea of pioneering solutions to unsolved problems from the ground up in uncharted territory sounds exciting to you, come join us!

EC2 produces an outrageous amount of complex data. Our data is modularized across teams but still interconnected. Without a deep understanding of the EC2 data landscape, it can be near impossible to figure out what metrics mean, where to find what, and how to join data across domains. Everyone in AWS uses data every day in some form or fashion, but it isn't always easy when you aren't a data expert and are also juggling keeping the internet running smoothly and delivering awesome new features for customers.

Our organization is seeking the leadership of a confident business intelligence engineer to catalyze a new generation of more efficient data consumption. You will lead our team in eliminating operational bottlenecks caused by data inapproachability, making deeper understanding of our services feasible for all those who seek it. You will be the subject matter expert on the EC2 data landscape. You will work with engineers and data scientists to help answer some of our toughest questions about our services and customers.

Here are some qualities that will make you enjoy and be successful in this role:

You dislike Excel and the idea of making yet another dry spreadsheet report makes your skin crawl. You are looking for a job with a technically challenging edge. Excel can’t handle the amount of data you will work with. You will rely almost entirely on python and in database operations. Tableau and Quicksight dashboards will take work to make performant. Unless optimized, your queries may actually run for forever.

You learn quickly and are good at figuring things out. You have enough technical acumen to be able to understand and model complex systems in unfamiliar domains. You appreciate the challenge of deriving insight from an engineer detailing technology in jargon that mostly go above your head.

You have a ‘can do’ attitude and a helpful spirit. You genuinely really enjoy making dashboards, fact tables, and writing queries. Getting pulled into adhoc BI requests doesn’t irritate you, but rather excites you. You enjoy getting occasionally interrupted by people dropping by your desk seeking your unique expertise. You have a passion for enabling self-service analytics and automation and strive for the day you are no longer pinged for adhoc help.

Within CSET You Will

Roles and responsibilities:
Build optimized, interactive dashboards to reduce effort and time required to obtain commonly needed business metrics
Create fact tables designed to allow for low latency adhoc analytics and load from production consumers
Assist data engineers build a data lake from which to perform analytics against
Own any team resources such as Redshift clusters or production dashboards
Document databases and metric learnings from service teams
Assist data scientists with data consolidation needed for research
Within The Compute Services Organization You Will
Act as the BI resource for our organization. Advise teams on database/table design best practices
Work with service teams to determine how to blend metrics to model systems and answer business questions

Basic Qualifications
Bachelors degree in applied mathematics, software engineering, statistics or other relevant quantitive discipline
3+ years experience with Redshift and experience or familiarity with AWS solutions such as EC2, DynamoDB, S3, and Redshift Spectrum, and Glue
Advanced competency with business intelligence tools including Quicksight and Tableau
2+ years of professional experience working with hundreds of terabytes of data
3+ years development experience in python or similar scripting language for automation
Expert-level skills in writing and optimizing SQL.
Preferred Qualifications
2+ years of professional experience working with hundreds of terabytes of data
Experience with common python data manipulation and visualization libraries
Experience or familiarity with Kinesis, IOT analytics, Sagemaker, and AWS Lake Formation

Amazon’s Automated Inventory Management (AIM) team is looking for a Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) with broad analytics and modeling experience to join a team that's developing state of the art technology to understand and measure the shopping experience of every Amazon customer. The charter of the Supply Chain Optimization Technology (SCOT) group is to deliver the best possible customer experience while maximizing the return on our inventory investment, fulfillment assets, and transportation network in terms of long term free cash flow. We are never satisfied with the status quo and are convinced that there is always opportunity to innovate on behalf of customers.

Unlike brick and mortar stores where it is challenging to capture customer interest in a product unless they actually purchase the item, e-commerce offers the unique advantage of capturing customer ""glance views"" even if they don't convert to sales. Glance views, or GVs, are a leading indicator of potential future demand and allow us to capture a comprehensive set of data points (eg. price, delivery speed) to understand what we showed the customer and the resultant customer behavior. Amazon uses GV datasets to metricize key performance indicators for customer experience like promised delivery speed and availability. As teams across Amazon innovate to present new shopping experiences to customers via the Amazon website or mobile shopping apps, our legacy GV logging systems are reaching the limit of their capabilities. We see a huge opportunity to rethink how we capture high fidelity data to understand customer experience and make this data available to teams across Amazon in a way that's easy to consume. As a BIE on the AIM team, you will need to understand what information is valuable to our internal customers and then work closely with the software development teams to design data models that are easy for end users to interpret and provide all data points necessary to extract comprehensive business insights. Given the scale at which Amazon operates, these systems will generate thousands of records per second. We will rely on your expertise to test and validate data at scale, set up mechanisms to catch data quality issues before they impact our customers, and build prototypes to generate business insights.

You will always be challenged to think several steps ahead so that the solutions we are building today will scale well with future growth and without adding excessive operational overhead. You will need to develop deep technical and business understanding of existing system (owned by us as well as other teams across Amazon) as you will responsible for identifying synergies and minimizing investment in redundant features. You will work with supply chain operations teams, in-house scientists, other BI Engineers, and software teams to identify enhancement opportunities and new features for our data products. In partnership with our Product Managers, you will analyze potential customer and financial impacts, identify the most promising ideas, and create a cohesive roadmap that makes the best use of available resources. You will also evangelize new features to our internal customers, working to accelerate feature adoption, track the realized impacts, and communicate results.

This is a highly visible role and will require regular interaction and communication with senior leaders. You must have experience and capability to document your work for technical as well as non-technical audiences. Successful candidates should excel at diving into data in order to analyze problems and implement simple, long term solutions. You will have the opportunity to thrive in a highly collaborative, creative, analytical, and fast-paced environment oriented around building the world’s most flexible and effective supply chain management technology.

Ever wondered how you can apply your analytics skills to drive customer experience improvements for a diverse, innovative, and fun company like Amazon?
Amazon’s Customer Insights and Research team is looking for a Business Intelligence Engineer (BIE) to help do exactly that and much more! If you have a combination of experience in automation (scripting) and statistical analysis, and are interested in going deeper into data science or machine learning, this is the right opportunity for you.
Our team is responsible for conducting global NPS studies to help business teams drive strategic initiatives that advocate for the best possible customer experience. You will have the opportunity to design, collect, analyze and present customer findings to business partners. We have a diverse suite of skill sets on the team, including Business Analysts, Business Intelligence Engineers, Data Scientists, Product Managers, and Software Development Engineers.
BIEs are responsible for ingesting data through our data pipelines, automating analysis for the various surveys that the team runs, run statistical tests on the data, and presenting data through visualization tools.
